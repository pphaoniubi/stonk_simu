**ReactJS/NodeJS**

This is a basic stock simulator application<br><br>
**Motivation:**<br>
- The reason I built this application is that I believe I can gain valuable stock insights by experimenting with a stock simulator. This could potentially help in making better buy/sell decisions in the future.

**Feature:**
- A fake money balance for simulated trading.
- Multi-user architecture, allowing multiple users to participate.
- Users can control the timeline, instantly forwarding one day by clicking a button.
- Stock prices update in real-time when the user advances the timeline.


**Project Steps:**
- Pull and store historical stock price data in a local database.
- Use NodeJS to send stock price data to ReactJS for processing.
- Use ReactJS to display historical stock prices in interactive charts.
- Implement multi-user functionality to allow multiple accounts.
  
**Project Goal:**<br>
- The main goal of this project is to build a stock simulator to experiment with stock trading while also learning the NodeJS framework.

**Key Takeaways:**
- NodeJS is easier to setup than Java Spring Boot. 
- Gained experience in implementing multi-user functionality.
